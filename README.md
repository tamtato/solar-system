# Pigello frontend test

## The project

The task is to build an interface that presents our solar system.

The API that will be used is [the Solar Sytem Open Data](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/rest/). This endpoint doesnâ€™t require authentication.

It is fine to use another API that can be used to represent our solar system.

## Technical description

- The user should be able to see a list of bodies in our solar system
- The user should be given enough data in the list to get a basic understanding of what planets and orbiting bodies are related to one another
- The user should be able to add their own body to the solar system (bonus for keeping the new body when reloading the page using frontend caching solutions)
- The list should be sortable and filterable through query params

## Practical description

- This project should be completed using React accompanied with whatever libraries that seems fitting for the scope of the project. Just remember that it's **your** code that is being assessed, not the libraries. There are two exceptions here; **Redux** and **Styled components** are required. A redux store and a styled component wrapper is prepared to avoid wasting time on boilerplate.
- This repo can be used as a starting point.
- The structure of this project should be thought through to allow for easy understanding and expansion of the project.
- We will look at several different aspects of the project when assesing it: UX, UI, structure, readability and functionality.
- Commit often, it helps us understand your workflow.
- Recommended time is about 90-180 minutes.

## Get started

1. Clone this repo
2. Install packages with yarn/npm
3. Finish the test in your own time
4. Upload it to Github and share it with us (Usernames: appzter and/or toranderr).
