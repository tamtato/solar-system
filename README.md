# Pigello frontend test

## My comments

When initially cloning and running npm install, I received an error for react-redux and that it had some dependency errors, this seems to be an error for npm versions 7.x

## Responsive Design

With more time I would have implemented better responsive design - Where it lacks is with screens 820(iPads) the layout is the same as a mobile so the content is a little stretched.

## Sorting Data

The data is sorted by body name ascending/descending and by default planets first. In a real project, I of course would discuss what sorting is needed and would implement a design that would work with that decision.

## Filtering and Created Body

With more time I would have liked to have added the created bodies to the filtered results.

## The project

The task is to build an interface that presents our solar system.

The API that will be used is [the Solar Sytem Open Data](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/rest/). This endpoint doesnâ€™t require authentication.

It is fine to use another API that can be used to represent our solar system.

## Technical description

- The user should be able to see a list of bodies in our solar system - Done
- The user should be given enough data in the list to get a basic understanding of what planets and orbiting bodies are related to one another - Done
- The user should be able to add their own body to the solar system (bonus for keeping the new body when reloading the page using frontend caching solutions) - Done
- The list should be sortable and filterable through query params - Done

## Practical description

- This project should be completed using React accompanied with whatever libraries that seems fitting for the scope of the project. Just remember that it's **your** code that is being assessed, not the libraries. There are two exceptions here; **Redux** and **Styled components** are required. A redux store and a styled component wrapper is prepared to avoid wasting time on boilerplate.
- This repo can be used as a starting point.
- The structure of this project should be thought through to allow for easy understanding and expansion of the project.
- We will look at several different aspects of the project when assesing it: UX, UI, structure, readability and functionality.
- Commit often, it helps us understand your workflow.
- Recommended time is about 90-180 minutes.

## Get started

1. Clone this repo
2. Install packages with yarn/npm
3. Finish the test in your own time
4. Upload it to Github and share it with us (Usernames: appzter and/or toranderr).
5. We'll get back to you for a quick discussion about the project

### Good luck!
